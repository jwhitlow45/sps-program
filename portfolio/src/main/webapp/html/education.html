      <p>
        I started attending College of the Sequoias, a community college in Visalia, California, in Summer of 2017 at age 17. While I had the
        grades to attend the colleges I was interested in, I ultimately chose community college to save money. At $400 a semester after
        financial aid it was the financially smart decision. I entered as a chemistry major and was sure that I wanted to be a pharmacist. My
        plan was to spend two years there and transfer to a state school where I could finish my bachelor's and apply to pharmacy school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three semesters into my chemistry degree I began to hate it. No matter how much I studied I struggled to retain the material. I quickly lost
        interest and began to program more in my free time to deal with the stress. I started going home from 6-hour chemistry labs and instead of finishing
        my labs I would program because it was one of the few things that felt productive and did not add to the stress from school. One night after a lab
        I realized that I could go to school for computer science. The next day I dropped organic chemistry, changed my major to computer science, and signed
        up for next semester's programming course. Since then I have done extremely well in all of my classes, transferring to California State University,
        Fresno in Fall 2020 after earning associate degrees in mathematics and university studies in math and sciences from College of the Sequoias.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite changing my major almost halfway through, setting me back a year and a half, I have never once regret the decision. I now get to study something
        that I enjoy and actively practice in my free time. I have also met many interesting people along the way and made friends that
        I expect I will have for a long time.
