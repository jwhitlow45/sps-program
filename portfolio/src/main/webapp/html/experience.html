      I began working on the California Web Application Project (CIWA) in September of 2020. Having just transferred to Fresno State, I was looking to do work
      under an instructor during the semester. One day, I received an email from Dr. Aris Athanasios Panagopoulos regarding an opportunity to join his research team.
      I quickly jumped on the opportunity and started attending his weekly meetings where I learned about the project as a whole and waited to find a role that I would
      be a good fit for. I soon began working on the database team and became familiar with the languages and technologies we use including Python, MSSQL, and Microsoft Azure.
      In March of 2021 our team lead left and I was offered his position. I gladly accepted and have since worked as the Database Team Lead, guiding
      the development and maintenance of the database while working with other teams to meet their needs.

      The basic premise of CIWA is to prevent the over or under-watering of crop trees across the Central Valley. This helps farmers make more money while helping save
      water. A value known as the water index is used to show how over or under-watered a tree is. The water index is determined by taking the temperature
      of the sunlit leaves of the tree. Using a thermal camera can allow taking the temperature of many leaves at once, giving a much more accurate water index than
      would be possible otherwise. This is the main goal of CIWA. By taking a thermal image of a tree and applying a nerual network to pick out sunlit leaves, the average
      sunlit leaf temperature, and therefore the water index, can be determined extremely quickly. In combination with the historical and current weather data I gather 
      and manage in our database, the crop yield for a tree can be estimated with a high degree of accuracy.
