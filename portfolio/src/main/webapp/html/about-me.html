      I am a computer science student from the Central Valley of California currently attending California State University, Fresno. 
      I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in computer science and hope to work as a Data Scientist once I graduate. 
      In my free time I enjoy spending time with my dogs Suki (right) and Sophie (left), building computers, and riding my motorcycle
      (particularly around the mountains near Lake Kaweah). I also enjoy playing video games on occasion, my favorite of which is
      the Borderlands series.

      My first adventure into programming was at the age of 13. I was really into modded Minecraft and one mod in particular, ComputerCraft,
      was very interesting to me. The mod allowed the use of the Lua programming language to control robots that could interact with the world
      around them. Through ComputerCraft I learned the basic fundamentals of programming including funcitonal programming, object-oriented programming,
      and basic abstraction. From here I began to look into other programming languages, primariliy C++ and eventually Python. This early interest led me
      to pursuing a career in computer science.
